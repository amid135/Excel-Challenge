Welcome to the Crowdfunding Campaign Analysis project! This assignment involves organizing and analyzing a database of 1,000 sample crowdfunding projects using Excel. Below, you'll find detailed instructions on setting up the project, tasks to complete, and what you need to deliver.

Before You Begin
To start this project, follow these steps:

Create Project Folder:
- Create a new folder named excel-challenge in your Dropbox or Google Drive specifically for this project.
- Do not add this project to an existing repository.

Store Excel Workbooks:
- Store all Excel workbooks related to this project in the excel-challenge folder.
- Ensure you have a sharable link for submission if required.

Download Files:
- Download the challenge files provided in the Module 1 Challenge files to begin your analysis.

Tasks Overview
Your analysis will involve the following tasks:

Data Formatting and Calculation:
- Use conditional formatting to categorize and highlight the outcome of each crowdfunding campaign (successful, failed, canceled, live).
- Create a new column, Percent Funded, to calculate how much money each campaign made relative to its initial funding goal.
- Calculate the Average Donation per backer for each project.

Categorization:
- Create new columns, Parent Category and Sub-Category, by splitting the existing Category and Sub-Category data.
- Category and Subcategory Analysis:

Create pivot tables and stacked-column pivot charts to analyze the number of campaigns based on their outcomes per category and subcategory.
Date Conversion and Analysis:
- Convert Unix timestamps in columns launched_at and deadline to Excel's date format using provided formulas.
- Analyze outcomes based on launch date using pivot tables and line charts.
C
Crowdfunding Goal Analysis:
- Create a new sheet with columns to categorize crowdfunding goals.
- Use COUNTIFS() formula to count successful, failed, and canceled projects within specified goal ranges.
- Calculate percentages of success, failure, and cancellation per goal range and create a line chart to visualize the data.

Statistical Analysis:
- Evaluate the number of backers for successful and unsuccessful campaigns.
- Calculate summary statistics including mean, median, minimum, maximum, variance, and standard deviation for both successful and unsuccessful campaigns.
- Analyze and interpret the variability of campaign success based on backer data.

Report Creation:
- Create a report in Microsoft Word answering specific questions about crowdfunding campaign trends, dataset limitations, and additional possible analyses.

Conclusion

By completing this Crowdfunding Campaign Analysis, you will gain insights into the trends and factors influencing the success of crowdfunding projects. This project will enhance your skills in Excel data manipulation, visualization, and statistical analysis.
